## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The steps rail lists each step in the draft's own order

The rail SHALL list every step of the draft, in the order `workflow.steps`
holds them. No walk over the paths SHALL decide where a row stands.

A row's number SHALL name the step's place in that order. Dragging a row to
any position in the list SHALL move it there. That move SHALL land in the
rail and in the draft together.

Each row SHALL carry a number and the step's label. A row SHALL have no summary
line under the label. That holds for every step kind: a task step, a call to
another process, and an end step. The step page names who works a step, the
fields its form carries, the process it calls and its outcome.

#### Scenario: The rail numbers steps in the draft's own order

- **WHEN** a draft holds a call step, then an end step, then a task step
- **THEN** the rail numbers the call one, the end two and the task three

#### Scenario: A move control moves its own row

- **WHEN** an author drags the rail's fourth row and drops it between the
  first and second row
- **THEN** that row stands second
- **AND** the rows that stood first through third each move one place later

#### Scenario: A keyboard move relocates the focused row

- **WHEN** an author focuses the rail's third row's grip and issues the
  move-later command
- **THEN** that row stands fourth
- **AND** keyboard focus stays on the moved row's grip
- **AND** a live region announces the row's label and its new position

#### Scenario: A task row names no assignment and no field count

- **WHEN** a task step names a group as its assignment and carries four view
  fields
- **THEN** its rail row carries the step's number and label
- **AND** the row names neither who works the step nor a field count

#### Scenario: A call row names no process

- **WHEN** a subprocess step calls the process labeled "Credit check"
- **THEN** its rail row has no line naming that process

#### Scenario: An end row names no outcome

- **WHEN** an end step declares the outcome `approved`
- **THEN** its rail row has no line naming that outcome

### Requirement: The rail reorders steps and adds new ones

Each rail row SHALL carry a grip that drags it to any position in the list.
A drop SHALL move that step to the dropped position in the draft. Each row SHALL also
answer a move-earlier and a move-later command from the keyboard whenever
an author focuses its grip.
`spa-accessibility` already requires this: a list offering a drag move
answers that same move from the keyboard, in the list itself. The first row
SHALL refuse the move-earlier command. The last row SHALL refuse the
move-later command.

The rail's foot SHALL carry three controls that add a step, a call to another
process, and an end.

#### Scenario: The first row cannot move earlier

- **WHEN** an author, with the rail's first row's grip focused, issues the
  move-earlier command
- **THEN** the row stays first

#### Scenario: The foot adds an end step

- **WHEN** an author presses the add-an-end control in the rail's foot
- **THEN** the draft carries one more end step
- **AND** the step page holds the new step
