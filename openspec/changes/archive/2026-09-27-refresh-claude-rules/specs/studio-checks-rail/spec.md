## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The rail reflects the held-back state of a structurally invalid draft

`validateStructure` (`src/validate.ts`) reports the duration and structural
dimensions as not run when the Zod parse fails and the compile pass raised
no duration or structural issue. CEL and registry checks do not run until the
draft compiles. The field `dimensions.structural` reads `"ran"`
both when the structural checks pass cleanly and when they run and
raise a structural issue. That field alone cannot tell the two states
apart.

The checks rail SHALL show the CEL and registry groups as held back
whenever the structural dimension did not run. It SHALL also show them
held back whenever the structural group's own issue list is non-empty.
It SHALL show the duration group as held back whenever
`validation.zodValid` is false. It SHALL NOT show a held-back group as
empty or passing.

The registry group covers three checks. Those checks read the action
types, the assignment strategy types and the data source types a body names.
Each check splits into a type-resolution half and a config-validation half.

The studio holds the registry type names once `useRegistry` has resolved
them. It reads them from the same registry response the plugin-config form
already reads. The registry group's type-resolution half SHALL therefore run
whenever the draft compiles and that response has resolved. It SHALL NOT
hold back for want of a registry once the response has resolved.

While `useRegistry` has not resolved a registry description for this
session, the type-resolution half SHALL read as held back. That covers both
states `useRegistry` collapses into one `undefined` result: still loading,
and resolved to nothing after a failed fetch. That held-back state is
distinct from the config-validation half's own held-back state below. It
clears once the fetch resolves for the session. The config-validation
half's held-back state does not clear.

The studio has no live registry schema, so it cannot validate a plugin
config. The registry group SHALL report its config-validation half as held
back in every draft state the studio can reach. A held-back config-validation
half is not itself an issue. That check still runs at publish time on the
server, and still blocks a publish there.

The CEL group covers process chaining targets alongside subprocess child
references. Both need a loaded target body. A chaining site whose target body
the studio has not loaded reads the same way an unloaded subprocess child
reads. The rail SHALL report it as not checked, per site, and never as
passing.

`ValidationResult` SHALL carry that per-site state in a dedicated field,
`chainingSiteStatus`. It carries that field the same way it already carries
`subprocessStepStatus` for the analogous subprocess case. A visible control
next to the `process.start` action itself SHALL show that state. That is the
same way the subprocess step's own fieldset already shows an unloaded child.

The structural group's own held-back state does not follow from
`zodValid` alone. `compileProcessBody` (`src/schema/compile.ts`) runs
duration validation before the structural checks, and raises on the
first duration issue without ever reaching them. A Zod-valid draft that
fails duration validation therefore never runs its structural checks
for that load, whatever `validation.zodValid` reports.

The checks rail SHALL show the structural group as held back whenever
structural checks did not run. The rail holds that group back when the
structural checks did not run, and runs it when they did. This holds even when
the draft is Zod-valid and the duration group shows its own, real issues.

The view group SHALL hold back whenever `validation.zodValid` is false,
and on nothing else. Its three rules read the Zod-parsed body directly,
which is the placement the duration group already takes. None of the
three needs a compiled body.

#### Scenario: A Zod-invalid draft shows every group held back

- **WHEN** the loaded draft is not Zod-valid
- **AND** the compile pass raised no structural issue
- **THEN** the checks rail shows the structural, CEL, registry, duration
  and view groups as held back
- **AND** it shows none of them as empty or passing

#### Scenario: A Zod-invalid draft with a structural issue shows that issue

- **WHEN** the loaded draft is not Zod-valid
- **AND** the compile pass raised a structural issue
- **THEN** the checks rail shows the structural group's actual issues
- **AND** it shows the CEL, registry, duration and view groups as held back

#### Scenario: A Zod-valid draft with a duration issue holds the structural group back too

- **WHEN** the loaded draft passes Zod validation but fails duration
  validation, so `compileProcessBody` raises before structural checks
  run
- **THEN** the checks rail shows the duration group's actual issues
- **AND** the checks rail shows the structural, CEL, and registry groups
  as held back
- **AND** it shows none of those three as empty or passing
- **AND** the view group runs, since it does not need a compiled body

#### Scenario: A Zod-valid, uncompilable draft holds back CEL and registry only

- **WHEN** the loaded draft passes Zod and duration validation but fails
  to compile
- **AND** that means a structural issue
- **THEN** the checks rail shows the CEL and registry groups as held back
- **AND** it shows the structural, duration, and view groups' actual
  issues

#### Scenario: A compiling draft resolves plugin types in all three registries

- **WHEN** the loaded draft compiles
- **AND** it names an action type, an assignment strategy type and a data
  source type
- **AND** the registry response holds none of those three
- **THEN** the checks rail shows one registry issue for each of the three
- **AND** the registry group does not show as held back for type resolution

#### Scenario: The type-resolution half holds back while the registry description has not resolved

- **WHEN** the loaded draft compiles
- **AND** `useRegistry` has not yet resolved a registry description for this
  session, whether still loading or after a failed fetch
- **THEN** the checks rail shows the registry group's type-resolution half as
  held back
- **AND** that state reads independently of `registryConfigHeldBack`, which
  stays `true` regardless

#### Scenario: A fully valid draft runs every group

- **WHEN** the loaded draft is Zod-valid and the structural dimension ran
  with no issue
- **THEN** the checks rail shows each of the zod, structural, CEL,
  duration, registry and view groups' actual issues
- **AND** any of those six groups with no issues shows a clear pass state
  instead
- **AND** the registry group still reports its config-validation half as
  held back
- **AND** the structural group still reports its unknown-key check as held
  back

#### Scenario: A chaining site with no loaded target reads as not checked

- **WHEN** the loaded draft compiles, and carries a `process.start` action
- **AND** the studio has not loaded that action's target process body
- **THEN** `chainingSiteStatus` reports that action's site as not checked
- **AND** the CEL group's own issue list has no entry for that site
- **AND** the group never presents that site as a clear pass
- **AND** a visible control beside that action shows the not-checked state
