## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The rail reports two view-flag stopping states

Two combinations of view flags stop a step, and the rail SHALL report
both. Each reads off `view.fields[]` alone. Each carries the `view`
source, and each anchors on the step that holds the view entry.

Both states SHALL read field entries alone. A note carries no `required`
and no `readonly`, so neither state can describe one. The rail SHALL skip
a note rather than report it. Each state names the field it found, and a
note names no field.

The first is a hidden requirement. A view entry with `visible` false and
`required` true drops the requirement without a word. `resolveFields`
removes the field before `requiredFieldIds` counts it. The rail SHALL
report that entry. It SHALL name the field.

The second is an unwritable requirement. Take a view entry with
`readonly` true and `required` true. Where nothing else writes the
field, every submission raises `required-missing`. `editableFieldIds`
excludes the field, so nobody can supply the value.

That second rule SHALL report only where five sources all leave the field
unwritten. No step's view makes it editable. No `Action.output`, no
`SubprocessSpec.outputMapping`, no `FieldDef.columnMapping` and no
`ProcessContract.inputFields` entry targets it. A calling parent seeds an
input field at spawn, outside any view. Real reachability over a cyclic
graph costs more than a warning earns. The rule therefore accepts a false
negative and SHALL raise no false positive.

Both rules read a literal flag alone. A flag holding a CEL expression
SHALL raise neither one. The engine resolves an expression against an
instance, and the studio holds none.

Neither rule SHALL read a view entry whose catalog field is a group
container. The engine resolves `required` and `readonly` to false for a
group. The editable set excludes one, and so does the required set. No
requirement exists there to drop or to strand.

#### Scenario: A hidden required field reports

- **WHEN** a step's view entry carries `visible: false` and
  `required: true`
- **THEN** the rail shows an entry under its `view` group, naming that
  field

#### Scenario: An unwritable required field reports

- **WHEN** a step's view entry carries `readonly: true` and
  `required: true`
- **AND** no step's view makes that field editable
- **AND** no action output, subprocess output mapping, column mapping or
  contract input field targets it
- **THEN** the rail shows an entry under its `view` group, naming that
  field

#### Scenario: A writable field raises nothing

- **WHEN** a step's view entry carries `readonly: true` and
  `required: true`
- **AND** an earlier step's view carries that field as editable
- **THEN** the rail shows no entry for it

#### Scenario: An action output counts as a writer

- **WHEN** a step's view entry carries `readonly: true` and
  `required: true`
- **AND** an `Action.output` map targets that field
- **THEN** the rail shows no entry for it

#### Scenario: A contract input field counts as a writer

- **WHEN** a step's view entry carries `readonly: true` and
  `required: true`
- **AND** this process's `contract.inputFields` names that field
- **THEN** the rail shows no entry for it

#### Scenario: A CEL flag raises neither rule

- **WHEN** a step's view entry carries `required: true` and a `visible`
  holding a CEL expression
- **THEN** the rail shows no entry for it

#### Scenario: A group container raises neither rule

- **WHEN** a step's view entry references a group-typed catalog field
  carrying `required: true`
- **THEN** the rail shows no entry for it, whatever `visible` and
  `readonly` hold

#### Scenario: A note draws no view-flag finding

- **WHEN** a step's view carries a note whose `visible` is false
- **THEN** the rail reports no hidden-requirement finding for that entry

#### Scenario: A field entry beside a note still draws its finding

- **WHEN** a step's view carries a note and a field entry with `visible` false
  and `required` true
- **THEN** the rail reports the hidden requirement, and names that field
