## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: A LocalizedText entry missing the current locale draws an inline warning

Take the studio's currently selected `contentLocale`. Take an entry that
carries the draft's `baseLocale` value but lacks that locale's own value.
That entry SHALL draw a warning next to its `LocalizedTextInput`. The
warning SHALL NOT be an `EditorIssue`, and SHALL NOT block or delay
publishing.

It SHALL draw at every `LocalizedTextInput` site:

- the process label
- each step's label and description
- each field's label and description
- each field option's label

An entry that lacks the `baseLocale` value SHALL NOT draw this warning.

A static rule in `packages/web/test/boundaries.test.ts` SHALL enforce that
list, scoped to `src/areas/studio/`. Every `LocalizedTextInput` rendered
there SHALL sit beside a call to `missingTranslationWarning`. An exempt site
SHALL instead carry an inline comment stating why. A hand-kept list does not
grow with the code. This rule does.

#### Scenario: A new render site warns

- **WHEN** the studio area gains a `LocalizedTextInput` site
- **THEN** the site calls `missingTranslationWarning`
- **AND** an untranslated entry draws the warning there

#### Scenario: An unguarded site fails the suite

- **WHEN** a source file under `src/areas/studio/` renders a
  `LocalizedTextInput` with no adjacent `missingTranslationWarning` call and
  no exempting comment
- **THEN** the boundary test names the file and fails

#### Scenario: An exempt site says why

- **WHEN** a site legitimately needs no warning
- **THEN** an inline comment states the reason, and the rule skips it
