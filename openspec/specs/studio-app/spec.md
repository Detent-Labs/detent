# studio-app Specification

## Purpose

The developer's frontend, the studio area of `packages/web`: a workspace package mirroring
the app area of `packages/web`'s shape (React 18, Vite 6, own build/typecheck, a hand-written
History-API routing hook, `session.ts` for the JWT under its own storage
key), reusing the existing login mechanism, with a role-aware shell, a
process list merging published and draft state, and the panel editing
surface (originally carried over from `packages/editor`, now deleted, and
independent of it since) wired to the draft routes instead of
file persistence — reaching the engine exclusively through the HTTP wrapper
at runtime and through the package's `exports` map at compile time only. See
the `process-drafts` capability for the server-side store and routes this
frontend calls, and the `authorization` capability for the `system:developer`
role its shell checks (presentationally) and every studio route enforces
(authoritatively).
## Requirements
### Requirement: Studio is a workspace package that reaches the engine only through its two sanctioned boundaries

Studio SHALL live at `packages/web/src/areas/studio`, inside the one workspace
package that produces a browser bundle (see the `unified-shell` capability). It
SHALL reach the running system at **runtime** exclusively through the HTTP
wrapper — never the database, never an engine module invoked in-process against
live state — and it SHALL import from the engine at **compile time** only
through the package's `exports` map (`workflow-engine/schema`,
`/schema/compile`, `/cel/check`, `/engine/registry-check`), which is what makes
live validation a pure frontend feature with no endpoint behind it.

Routing within the area SHALL stay a pure matcher and path builder over paths
relative to the `/studio` prefix, driven by the shell's one History-API hook,
with no router dependency. Studio SHALL NOT import from another area's
directory, and SHALL NOT modify `packages/form-ui`.

#### Scenario: No direct data access

- **WHEN** `packages/web/src/areas/studio` is inspected for imports
- **THEN** it imports no database client and no engine module by deep path,
  only the exports-map entry points and its own HTTP client

#### Scenario: No cross-area import

- **WHEN** the studio area's sources are inspected
- **THEN** nothing under it imports from another area's directory

### Requirement: The shell routes to Tools and Player alongside the process list

The studio area SHALL offer navigation to `/studio/tools` (see the
`studio-tools` capability) and to a per-process Player at
`/studio/processes/:processId/play` (see the `studio-player` capability),
reachable the same way the process list already is — behind the shell's
`system:developer` presentational check, with every route it calls enforcing
the role authoritatively.

#### Scenario: Tools is reachable from the shell

- **WHEN** an authenticated actor holding `system:developer` uses the studio
  area's navigation
- **THEN** a link to `/studio/tools` is present and renders the Tools screen

#### Scenario: Player is reachable from a process's edit context

- **WHEN** an authenticated actor holding `system:developer` opens a process
- **THEN** a link to that process's Player screen is present

### Requirement: Studio authenticates with the existing login and session mechanism

Studio SHALL NOT authenticate at all. The shell owns the one login screen and
the one session under one storage key (see the `unified-shell` capability), and
the studio area sends that session's token as the bearer credential on every
request. Any `401` from any studio request SHALL discard the stored session and
return the user to `/login`, the same handling every other area gets. Studio
SHALL NOT introduce a new authentication mechanism, token format, or credential
store, and SHALL NOT hold a storage key of its own.

An actor already signed in elsewhere in the shell SHALL reach `/studio` with no
second sign-in.

#### Scenario: A successful login opens the shell

- **WHEN** an actor holding `system:developer` submits valid credentials
- **THEN** the session is persisted and the process list is reachable at
  `/studio`

#### Scenario: An expired session returns to login

- **WHEN** any studio request answers 401
- **THEN** the stored session is cleared and the login screen is shown

#### Scenario: No second sign-in

- **WHEN** an actor already signed in under another area navigates to `/studio`
- **THEN** no login screen appears

### Requirement: An authenticated actor without the developer role sees an explanatory empty state

The shell SHALL read the roles the login response carries. When the account
holds none of `system:developer`, `system:author` and `system:templates`, the
shell SHALL render an explanatory screen. That screen SHALL state that the
account lacks studio access. The shell SHALL NOT redirect to `/login`, because
the credentials are valid. It SHALL NOT render a partly populated screen.

An account holding `system:templates` alone SHALL enter the area and reach
the templates screen only. Every other studio screen SHALL refuse it and
SHALL state which role the account lacks.

An account holding `system:author` alone SHALL enter the area. It SHALL reach
the process list, the editor, the versions screen and the player. The
migration screen, the tools screen and the templates screen SHALL refuse it.
Each SHALL state which role the account lacks.

This client-side check only decides what the shell renders. Every studio route
SHALL stay gated server-side whatever the browser decides.

#### Scenario: A participant account learns why studio is empty

- **WHEN** an actor holding no studio role logs in to studio
- **THEN** an explanatory empty state renders
- **AND** the shell renders neither the login screen nor any process or draft
  data

#### Scenario: A curator enters the area and reaches one screen

- **WHEN** an actor holding only `system:templates` logs in to studio
- **THEN** the templates screen renders
- **AND** the process list refuses and names the missing role

#### Scenario: An author enters the area and reaches the process list

- **WHEN** an actor holding only `system:author` logs in to studio
- **THEN** the process list renders
- **AND** the migration screen refuses and names the missing role

#### Scenario: The frontend check is not the control

- **WHEN** a client that skipped the shell check calls a draft route directly
- **THEN** the server still answers 403

### Requirement: The process list shows draft and published state per process

The `/processes` screen SHALL list one row per process reachable to the
developer, combining `GET /processes` and `GET /drafts`. Each row SHALL show
whether a draft exists and, if so, who last saved it and when, and the latest
published version with its `definitionHash`. A process with a draft but no
published version and a process with published versions but no draft SHALL
both render correctly.

Actions SHALL be: create a new process, open a process for editing, and
discard its draft. Discarding SHALL require a confirmation and SHALL call
`DELETE /drafts/:processId`, leaving published versions untouched.

#### Scenario: A never-published process appears

- **WHEN** a draft exists for a process with no `definitions` rows
- **THEN** the row renders with its draft metadata and an empty published
  column

#### Scenario: A published process with no draft appears

- **WHEN** a process has published versions and no draft
- **THEN** the row renders the latest version and its hash, and offers
  creating a draft rather than opening one

#### Scenario: Discarding removes only the draft

- **WHEN** discard is confirmed for a process with published versions
- **THEN** the draft disappears from the list and the published version and
  hash still render

### Requirement: Creating a new process mints a prefixed id client-side

Creating a process SHALL mint a `proc_`-prefixed UUIDv4 id in the browser.
It SHALL use the minting path the Draft model already uses for every other
entity kind. That path generates `${prefix}_${crypto.randomUUID()}` and
parses it through the contract's own branded id schema. Creating SHALL then
write the row with a `PUT /drafts/:processId` at `revision = 0`. There SHALL
be no separate create-then-save round trip and no server-side id allocation.

Creating SHALL first offer a choice of starting body. The empty choice SHALL
seed the body the studio seeds today. The template choice SHALL seed the body
and the layout of a template the author picks. The picker SHALL list the
templates the account may read.

A process seeded from a template SHALL claim no base version, because a
template is no published version.

#### Scenario: A new process is one round trip

- **WHEN** an author creates a new process
- **THEN** the browser issues exactly one `PUT /drafts/:processId`, with
  `revision` 0, and the process id carries the `proc_` prefix

#### Scenario: The empty choice behaves as before

- **WHEN** an author creates a new process and picks the empty choice
- **THEN** the draft body declares the base locale and nothing else

#### Scenario: The template choice seeds body and layout

- **WHEN** an author creates a new process from a template
- **THEN** the draft holds that template's body and layout
- **AND** the draft carries no base version

#### Scenario: An author with no readable template still creates a process

- **WHEN** an author creates a new process while no template exists
- **THEN** the picker offers the empty choice and states that no template
  exists

### Requirement: Creating a draft for a published process starts from the latest published version

Creating a draft from the process list SHALL seed the draft body from the
process's latest published version. The studio SHALL read that body through
the published-version route before it writes the draft. It SHALL send the
result as the new draft's body, at `revision = 0`.

The published-version route returns the compiled body. A draft holds the
authored shape. The studio SHALL therefore strip the content the compile
pass injects before it writes the draft. That content is the reserved
cancel-sink step and, for a contracted process, the reserved cancel outcome
in `contract.outcomes`. The studio SHALL strip nothing else.

The write SHALL declare the version it seeded from as the draft's
`baseVersion`. The Versions screen compares the draft against it.

The seeded draft SHALL carry no stored layout. The canvas places steps that
have no recorded position, so a seeded process renders without one.

Creating a draft for a process with no published version SHALL write a body
declaring `baseLocale: "en"` and nothing else. It SHALL declare no base
version. Creating a new process SHALL keep both of those.

Publish requires `baseLocale`. The seed is the only place the structural
panels can supply it before the author has typed anything. The chosen value
matches the fallback every other studio reader already applies to a draft
that declares no base locale.

When the read of the published version fails, the studio SHALL report the
error and SHALL NOT write a draft. An empty draft must not silently replace
the seeded one. The process list would then show a draft the author never
authored.

#### Scenario: A published process seeds its draft

- **WHEN** a draft is created for a process with a published version
- **THEN** the stored draft body equals that version's authored shape, and
  the draft carries `revision` 0 with `baseVersion` set to that version. The
  edit screen renders the process's steps

#### Scenario: The seeded body carries no compile-pass content

- **WHEN** a draft is seeded from a published version of a contracted process
- **THEN** the stored body carries no step with the reserved cancel-sink id
  or key, and `contract.outcomes` carries no reserved cancel outcome

#### Scenario: The seeded body passes the studio's own validation

- **WHEN** a seeded draft is loaded into the edit screen
- **THEN** live validation reports no error that the published version did
  not already carry

#### Scenario: A never-published process starts with a base locale only

- **WHEN** a draft is created for a process with no published version
- **THEN** the stored draft body declares `baseLocale: "en"` and carries no
  other key. The draft carries no base version, and the edit screen renders
  no steps

#### Scenario: A new process starts with a base locale only

- **WHEN** a new process is created from the process list
- **THEN** the stored draft body declares `baseLocale: "en"` and carries no
  other key, and no published-version read precedes the write

#### Scenario: The new-process seed reports no missing base locale

- **WHEN** the body a new process starts from is parsed as an authored
  process body
- **THEN** no reported error names `baseLocale`

#### Scenario: A failed seed read writes no draft

- **WHEN** the published-version read fails while a draft is being created
- **THEN** the screen reports the error and no draft write follows. The
  process list still shows the process as having no draft

### Requirement: Editing is a canvas-primary surface, with the process-wide views on a routed screen

The `/processes/:id/edit` screen SHALL carry over the editor's Draft
model (`draft/`), UI-chrome i18n, and live validation. It SHALL also
carry over the structural panels (`panels/`). These panels are steps,
paths, timers, actions, subprocess spec, view editor, field catalog,
data sources, and contract. The draft routes replace file-based
persistence. `GET /drafts/:processId` loads the draft.
`PUT /drafts/:processId` saves it and carries the revision the load
call returned.

The screen's layout SHALL be canvas-primary. An interactive graph (see
the `studio-canvas` capability) occupies the top of the editing well. A
fixed-width section index beside the canvas lists the selected step's
own sections and their entity counts. Those sections are identity,
assignment, paths, timers, actions, subprocess spec, and view. See the
`studio-canvas` capability for how choosing an entry behaves.

The process header's `⋮` overflow menu SHALL carry `baseLocale`. This
capability requires an author to declare a non-English base locale
without leaving the Structure surface. The panels screen SHALL NOT hold
it.

Four links SHALL sit in the canvas edit screen's rail, under a Process
heading: Fields, Data sources, Contract, Field matrix. See the
`studio-canvas` capability's layout requirement for the rail. Each link
SHALL navigate to the panels screen, opened at its own view. These four
views cover the whole process, not one step. The links stay reachable
whether or not the author has selected a step on the canvas.

The links SHALL belong to the Structure surface alone. The screen SHALL
NOT offer them while the JSON surface is active. All four views mutate
the draft body, and the `studio-json-view` capability requires that no
draft-body-mutating control stays reachable there.

This requirement governs where the screen mounts each panel, and how an
author reaches it. What each panel validates, mutates, or persists
stays the same.

Every inline missing-translation warning SHALL survive the move. Six
`LocalizedTextInput` sites carry one.

- the process label, which stays on the screen
- a step's label and description, which move into the section index's
  identity section
- a field's label and description, and a field option's label, which
  move into the panels screen's Fields view

Live validation SHALL remain exactly what it is today. It runs the
engine's own publish-time chain in the browser and reports issues in
place. It SHALL NOT block saving, since a work-in-progress draft is
normally invalid.

The section index SHALL carry one issue count for the selected step as
a whole. That count SHALL cover the step's own issues, and the issues of
its paths, timers and actions. Here `resolveLoc` returns the deepest
entity it finds. A guard's issue therefore names the path, not the step.
A count over the step's own id alone would read zero on such a step.

The panels screen's index rail SHALL carry one issue count per view.
Both counts SHALL use the same visual tone. The rest of the studio area
already uses that tone for issues.

Per-section issue counts are out of scope. `resolveLoc` resolves a
view, assignment or subprocess-spec issue to the step itself. No
per-section number exists to report.

The screen SHALL offer a **Publish** action (see the `studio-publish`
capability). It calls `POST /drafts/:processId/publish` against the
currently persisted draft, not the in-browser draft state. When local
changes remain unsaved, the action SHALL prompt the user to save
first. It must not publish stale or ahead-of-server content. On
success, the screen SHALL confirm the new version number and
`definitionHash`.

#### Scenario: A draft round-trips through the panels

- **WHEN** the developer loads a draft, adds a step through the panels,
  saves the draft, and reloads it
- **THEN** the panels surface the new step identically

#### Scenario: A draft round-trips through the canvas

- **WHEN** the developer loads a draft, repositions a step, connects it
  to another step, then saves and reloads it
- **THEN** the canvas renders the new position and path identically

#### Scenario: An invalid draft is still saveable

- **WHEN** live validation reports issues for the current draft
- **THEN** the screen displays the issues, keeps the save action
  available, and the save succeeds

#### Scenario: A Structure-surface link opens the panels screen

- **WHEN** the developer clicks the Fields, Data sources, Contract, or
  Field matrix link in the rail's Process section
- **THEN** the panels screen opens at that view, and the address bar
  carries that view's own path

#### Scenario: A link opens the panels screen with no step selected

- **WHEN** the developer clicks one of those links before selecting any
  step on the canvas
- **THEN** the panels screen still opens at that view

#### Scenario: The JSON surface renders no link into the panels screen

- **WHEN** the developer switches to the JSON surface
- **THEN** the four links are absent, and no control on screen reaches
  the panels screen

#### Scenario: Publishing with unsaved changes prompts a save first

- **WHEN** the developer clicks Publish while local changes remain
  unsaved
- **THEN** the studio prompts the developer to save before publishing,
  and does not call `POST /drafts/:processId/publish` until the save
  completes

#### Scenario: The screen confirms a successful publish

- **WHEN** `POST /drafts/:processId/publish` succeeds
- **THEN** the screen displays the returned version number and
  `definitionHash`

### Requirement: The panels screen is a routed sub-state of the edit screen

The four process-wide views SHALL sit on a routed screen, not behind a
dialog. The path SHALL read `/processes/:id/edit/panels/:view`. Here
`:view` is one of `fields`, `dataSources`, `contract` or `matrix`.

That path SHALL be a sub-state of the `edit` route. It rides as an
optional field on the same route object, the shape `formStepId` already
takes. The `studio-form-editor` capability routes its own screen that
way.

An unrecognized `:view` SHALL fall back to the edit screen's own
canvas. The routing table already answers an unrecognized path with the
process list, and this is that rule one level down.

The screen SHALL lay out three columns, in order: an index rail, the
open view, and the checks rail. See the `studio-checks-rail` capability
for what the rail shows here.

The panels screen SHALL replace the canvas while it is open. It SHALL
offer one control back to it.

The three columns SHALL fill the height the screen's header rows leave,
above the floor the canvas layout uses. A taller window
therefore shows taller columns, and no empty band sits below them. This
is the rule `studio-canvas` states for the canvas edit screen, and the
panels screen stands in the same well.

#### Scenario: The columns fill a tall window

- **WHEN** the developer opens the panels screen on a window taller
  than the floor
- **THEN** the three columns reach the bottom of the well, and no empty
  band sits below them

#### Scenario: A short window holds the floor

- **WHEN** the developer opens the panels screen on a window shorter
  than the floor
- **THEN** the columns hold that floor and the page scrolls

#### Scenario: A view has its own address

- **WHEN** the developer opens the Data sources view
- **THEN** the address bar reads that view's path, and loading that
  path directly opens the same view

#### Scenario: A reload keeps the open view

- **WHEN** the developer reloads the browser on the Contract view
- **THEN** the screen reopens on the Contract view, not on the canvas

#### Scenario: Back leaves the screen rather than the process

- **WHEN** the developer reaches the panels screen from the canvas and
  presses the browser's Back control
- **THEN** the canvas returns, and the draft keeps every change

#### Scenario: An unknown view falls back to the canvas

- **WHEN** the developer loads `/processes/:id/edit/panels/nonsense`
- **THEN** the edit screen's canvas renders, and the screen reports no
  issue

### Requirement: The panels screen keeps every change and states so

<!-- antislop: allow synonym-rotation -->
<!-- Why: the toolbar's Discard control drops every unsaved change. The
     panel's Remove control drops one entity. Two separate controls,
     each keeping its own name. -->
The panels screen SHALL carry no Save control. Every change an author
makes on it SHALL write straight into the in-browser draft. That is how
the panels write today. The screen's own Save, Discard and Publish
toolbar SHALL remain the only thing that persists.

Leaving the screen SHALL discard nothing. The screen SHALL state that
plainly, so leaving never reads as a cancel.

A panel's own unsubmitted input SHALL survive a switch between views.
The contract panel holds a half-typed outcome name in component state.
The data sources panel fetches its list keys on mount. The field matrix
holds its selected cell in component state. All four views SHALL
therefore stay mounted for as long as the panels screen is open.
Switching a view SHALL reveal and hide them, rather than mount them.

An index rail SHALL list the four views. Each entry SHALL carry two
numbers, and they SHALL read as different things. The entity count says
how many fields, data sources, outcomes or live cells the view holds.
The issue count says how many of them are wrong. Only the issue count
takes the refusal tone. An entry SHALL carry no issue count when the
view holds no issue.

For the Fields view and for the Data sources view the rail SHALL also
list that view's own entities and an Add entry. Choosing an entity SHALL
select it. The view SHALL render that one entity's editor. The Add entry
SHALL add an entity, through the call the panel's own add control makes.
A group field's children indent one level under it.

Contract holds a single editor, so its rail entry SHALL carry no
sub-list. The field matrix draws a grid, so its entry SHALL carry none
either.

The rail SHALL render a sub-list only under the open view. Two
sub-lists at once fill the column.

A group field SHALL keep one recursive editor. Choosing a child in the
rail SHALL select the parent group and scroll the child into view inside
that editor.

A selection SHALL live in component state and SHALL take no address of
its own. The screen SHALL select the first entity on mount. It SHALL
select the added entity after an Add.
<!-- antislop: allow synonym-rotation -->
<!-- Why: the panel's Remove control drops one entity. The toolbar's
     Discard control drops every unsaved change. The two are separate
     controls, so neither word may stand in for the other. -->
It SHALL select the neighbour after a Remove. Switching to another view
and back SHALL keep the selection the first view held.

Each entity entry SHALL carry its own issue mark, separate from the
view entry's issue count. One entity at a time otherwise hides a broken
entity behind whichever entry an author has open.

The rail SHALL mark the open view with `aria-current`. A rail entry
switches a view rather than disclosing adjacent content, so it SHALL
NOT carry `aria-expanded`.

The rail SHALL cap indentation at two levels. A group field's children
indent once. A field nested deeper SHALL take its own top-level rail
entry rather than a deeper indent. This is a rail-rendering rule only:
the draft's own field tree SHALL keep whatever depth it declares.

#### Scenario: Leaving the screen keeps every change

- **WHEN** the developer adds a field on the screen and then returns to
  the canvas
- **THEN** the draft still carries that field, and the screen's toolbar
  still reports unsaved changes

#### Scenario: Switching views keeps a half-typed outcome name

- **WHEN** the developer types an outcome name in the Contract view,
  switches to Fields without adding it, then switches back
- **THEN** the typed text is still in the input

#### Scenario: Switching views keeps the field matrix's selected cell

- **WHEN** the developer selects a live cell in the Field matrix view,
  switches to Contract, then switches back
- **THEN** the same cell is still selected, and its editor still shows

#### Scenario: The screen offers no Save of its own

- **WHEN** the developer inspects the open screen
- **THEN** it carries no Save control, and it states that it keeps
  every change

#### Scenario: The rail lists each view with its entity count

- **WHEN** a draft carries three fields, two data sources, and a
  contract
- **THEN** the rail's Fields entry reads three, its Data sources entry
  reads two, and its Contract entry carries no sub-list

#### Scenario: The rail's issue count is separate from its entity count

- **WHEN** a draft carries three fields and one of them holds a
  validation issue
- **THEN** the rail's Fields entry reads three for its entity count and
  one for its issue count. Only the issue count takes the refusal tone

#### Scenario: A view with no issue shows no issue count

- **WHEN** a draft's two data sources both validate
- **THEN** the rail's Data sources entry reads two and shows no issue
  count

#### Scenario: A twice-nested group field takes its own rail entry

- **WHEN** a group field holds a group field holding a leaf field
- **THEN** the leaf field takes a top-level rail entry, not a third
  indent level. The draft keeps its own nesting

#### Scenario: The Fields view renders the selected field alone

- **WHEN** a draft carries three fields and the developer chooses the
  second in the rail
- **THEN** the Fields view renders that field's editor, and it renders
  neither of the other two

#### Scenario: The Data sources view renders the selected data source alone

- **WHEN** a draft carries two data sources and the developer chooses
  the second in the rail
- **THEN** the Data sources view renders that data source's editor, and
  it renders no other

#### Scenario: The rail sub-list follows the open view

- **WHEN** the developer opens the Data sources view on a draft that
  carries both fields and data sources
- **THEN** the rail lists the data sources under that entry, and it
  lists no field under the Fields entry

#### Scenario: A group child selects its group

- **WHEN** the developer chooses a group field's child in the rail
- **THEN** the view renders the group's own recursive editor, and it
  scrolls the child into view inside that editor

#### Scenario: The Fields rail adds a field

- **WHEN** the developer chooses the rail's Add entry under Fields
- **THEN** the draft carries one more field, the rail lists it, and the
  view renders that new field

#### Scenario: Removing a field selects its neighbour

- **WHEN** the developer removes the selected field from a draft that
  carries three
- **THEN** the view renders a neighbouring field, and it reports no
  empty selection

#### Scenario: A reload selects the first entity

- **WHEN** the developer reloads the browser on the Fields view
- **THEN** the view renders the first field in the catalog

#### Scenario: The Data sources rail adds a data source

- **WHEN** the developer chooses the rail's Add entry under Data sources
- **THEN** the draft carries one more data source, the rail lists it, and
  the view renders that new data source

#### Scenario: Removing a data source selects its neighbour

- **WHEN** the developer removes the selected data source from a draft
  that carries three
- **THEN** the view renders a neighbouring data source, and it reports no
  empty selection

#### Scenario: A reload selects the first data source

- **WHEN** the developer reloads the browser on the Data sources view
- **THEN** the view renders the first data source in the draft

#### Scenario: Each entity entry marks its own issue

- **WHEN** a draft's second field holds a validation issue, and the
  developer has the first field selected
- **THEN** the second field's own rail entry carries an issue mark

#### Scenario: The screen keeps every missing-translation warning

- **WHEN** the studio's `contentLocale` is `de`, and a draft's field has
  a `label` carrying the base-locale value but no `de` value
- **THEN** the screen's Fields view shows the missing-translation
  warning next to that field's label input

### Requirement: The Fields and Data sources views take the area's field rule

Both views SHALL render their editors under the design language's field
rule. The rule `.steps-panel label` states it in the area today. A
label SHALL sit above its control. A `key` and a `type` SHALL print in
mono, because the engine matches both exactly. A hairline SHALL divide
rail rows, and a rule SHALL sit under a view's heading. No corner SHALL
take a radius.

#### Scenario: A field editor states its labels above its controls

- **WHEN** the developer opens the Fields view on any field
- **THEN** each label sits above its own control, and no label sits
  beside one

#### Scenario: A key prints in mono

- **WHEN** the developer opens the Fields view on any field
- **THEN** the field's key and its type print in the mono face

### Requirement: The field matrix lists every catalog field against every workflow step

The field matrix view SHALL draw a grid. Its rows are the field
catalog, depth-first flattened in catalog order: a group field
immediately followed by its own children. Its columns are
`workflow.steps`, in array order. The grid SHALL include every catalog
field and every step. This holds whether or not a given step's view
references a given field.

Each cell SHALL draw in one of three states:

- **Hatched**, where the column's step declares no `view` at all. Every
  cell in that column SHALL draw hatched, regardless of the row.
- **Blank**, where the step declares a `view` and that view's `fields`
  carries no entry referencing the row's field.
- **Live**, where such an entry exists. A live cell SHALL show a
  compact summary of that entry's `visible`, `required` and `readonly`
  flags. That summary SHALL show whether any of the three carries a CEL
  expression.

#### Scenario: The grid covers the whole catalog and the whole step list

- **WHEN** the developer opens the field matrix on a draft with N
  catalog fields and M workflow steps
- **THEN** the grid draws N rows and M columns, independent of how many
  view entries exist

#### Scenario: A group field heads its own children

- **WHEN** the field catalog declares a group field with nested fields
- **THEN** the group's row sits immediately above its children's rows,
  in the same order the field catalog panel lists them

#### Scenario: A step with no view hatches its whole column

- **WHEN** a workflow step declares no `view`
- **THEN** every cell in that step's column draws hatched, for every
  field row

#### Scenario: An unreferenced field on a view-bearing step draws blank

- **WHEN** a workflow step declares a `view` whose `fields` carries no
  entry for a given catalog field
- **THEN** that field's cell in that step's column draws blank

#### Scenario: A referenced field draws live with its flags summarized

- **WHEN** a workflow step's view carries an entry referencing a
  catalog field
- **THEN** that cell draws live
- **AND** its summary reflects the entry's resolved `visible`,
  `required` and `readonly` values

### Requirement: Selecting a live cell opens one flag editor for that (step, field) pair

The field matrix SHALL offer no per-cell input controls. Selecting a
live cell SHALL open one editor region below the grid. It SHALL appear
once, and it SHALL target exactly the selected cell's view entry.

The editor SHALL offer `visible`, `required` and `readonly` as
independent boolean-or-CEL controls. Each SHALL start from the entry's
own resolved value: an absent key reads the engine's own default, not
false. Changing a control SHALL write to that entry's key on selection.
It SHALL delete the key on a return to its default. That is the same
write the `studio-form-editor` capability's strip already performs
through `setFlag`.

Where the selected cell's own `visible` is a literal `false`, the
editor SHALL disable `required` and `readonly`, the same gating
`studio-form-editor`'s strip already applies.

Selecting a hatched or a blank cell SHALL close the editor, or leave it
closed. Neither state names a view entry to edit.

#### Scenario: Selecting a live cell opens its editor

- **WHEN** the developer selects a live cell
- **THEN** the editor appears below the grid, showing that cell's
  `visible`, `required` and `readonly` controls at their resolved
  values

#### Scenario: Editing a control writes the same entry the form editor writes

- **WHEN** the developer changes one of the editor's three controls
- **THEN** the underlying step's view entry for that field updates
  immediately, in the in-browser draft, without a Save control

#### Scenario: A control returning to its default clears the key

- **WHEN** the developer sets a control back to the engine's own
  default for that flag
- **THEN** the corresponding key is absent from the view entry. It does
  not carry the default value instead

#### Scenario: Turning visible off disables the other two controls

- **WHEN** the developer sets the selected cell's `visible` control to
  literal `false`
- **THEN** the `required` and `readonly` controls disable, and their
  keys clear from the entry

#### Scenario: Selecting a hatched or blank cell shows no editor

- **WHEN** the developer selects a hatched cell or a blank cell
- **THEN** no flag editor appears for it

### Requirement: The field matrix's rail entry counts view entries and view findings

The panels screen's index rail SHALL show the field matrix's entity
count. That count is the total number of view entries across every
step in the draft. A live cell represents one of that same total.

This is the matrix's analogue of two other counts. The Fields view
counts catalog rows. The Contract view counts outcomes.

The field matrix's issue count SHALL equal the number of open findings
`checkViewFlags` reports over the whole draft. Those are the
`view`-sourced findings the `studio-checks-rail` capability's rail
already groups under that name. The count SHALL NOT come from the step
entity type. A `checkViewFlags` finding shares that entity type with
every other per-step issue in the draft.

#### Scenario: The entity count matches the live-cell total

- **WHEN** the developer opens the field matrix on a draft with 54 view
  entries across its steps
- **THEN** the rail's Field matrix entry shows 54 as its entity count

#### Scenario: The issue count reflects only view-source findings

- **WHEN** the draft carries one `checkViewFlags` finding and several
  unrelated issues on the same steps, from other sources
- **THEN** the rail's Field matrix entry shows an issue count of 1, not
  a count including the unrelated issues

### Requirement: The process header declares the process's base locale

The process header's `⋮` overflow menu SHALL carry a control that reads
and writes the process's `baseLocale`. An author SHALL be able to
declare a non-English base locale without leaving the Structure surface.

`baseLocale` decides which entry of every `LocalizedText` in the body is
mandatory, and publish requires it. Leaving it to the JSON surface alone made
a process authored only through the structural panels unpublishable.

The control SHALL write the typed value through, unvalidated. Live
validation reports a value that is not a well-formed locale code. That
is the route every other malformed authored value takes. The menu SHALL
NOT reject or correct the keystroke.

When the typed value is a well-formed locale code, the studio SHALL also move
the edited content locale to it.

Without that move, the control opens a trap. The edited content locale decides
which entry every text input writes. It also decides which entry a newly
created step or field seeds. An author who declares `de` and keeps typing
would write every value under the previous locale. Each new entity would then
report a missing `de` entry while visibly holding text.

The studio SHALL NOT move the edited content locale for a value that is not a
well-formed locale code. A part-typed value would otherwise become a real
locale key. One character typed into any text field is enough.

#### Scenario: The header shows the draft's declared base locale

- **WHEN** the edit screen loads a draft declaring `baseLocale: "de"`
- **THEN** opening the process header's `⋮` menu shows a base-locale
  control reading `de`

#### Scenario: Declaring a base locale moves the edited content locale

- **WHEN** an author changes the process header's base-locale control to `de`
- **THEN** the draft body's `baseLocale` is `de`, and the edited content
  locale is `de`. A step created next seeds its label under `de`

#### Scenario: A part-typed base locale leaves the content locale alone

- **WHEN** an author has typed `d` on the way to `de`
- **THEN** the draft body's `baseLocale` is `d`, and the edited content locale
  is whatever it was before

#### Scenario: Existing text without an entry for the new base locale reports

- **WHEN** an author changes the base locale to `de` on a process whose labels
  carry only `en` entries
- **THEN** live validation reports a missing base-locale entry for every
  `LocalizedText` in the body that carries no `de` entry

#### Scenario: A malformed base locale reports as a validation issue

- **WHEN** an author types a value into the base-locale control that is
  not a well-formed locale code
- **THEN** the draft body carries that value, and live validation
  reports the issue against `baseLocale`

### Requirement: A save conflict is surfaced and resolved by reloading, never merged

When `PUT /drafts/:processId` answers 409, the studio SHALL tell the user that
the draft was changed elsewhere and SHALL offer reloading the stored draft. It
SHALL NOT merge, SHALL NOT silently retry with the newer revision, and SHALL
NOT discard the conflict.

Reloading SHALL leave the editor in a **clean** state: the body the toolbar
treats as "last known persisted" SHALL be advanced to the reloaded body, in
the same operation that replaces the draft, the layout and the revision. A
reload is by definition the point at which current and saved coincide — the
same invariant the initial seed and the post-save advance already encode.

Without this the unsaved-changes comparison is made against the discarded
local edits, so a draft byte-identical to the stored one reads as dirty for
the rest of the session (the toolbar is not remounted by a reload). Publishing
then always prompts to save first: accepting re-writes the just-fetched body
and bumps the stored revision for nothing, invalidating a concurrent editor's
in-flight revision, and declining aborts a publish the user was entitled to
make.

#### Scenario: A conflicting save is reported

- **WHEN** a save answers 409
- **THEN** a conflict message is shown with a reload action, and the local
  editing state is left intact until the user chooses

#### Scenario: Reloading adopts the stored draft

- **WHEN** the user reloads after a conflict
- **THEN** the stored body, layout and revision replace the local state and a
  subsequent save succeeds

#### Scenario: Publishing straight after a reload does not prompt to save

- **WHEN** the user reloads after a conflict and immediately publishes,
  without editing
- **THEN** the publish proceeds without the unsaved-changes prompt, because
  the draft is identical to the stored one

#### Scenario: Editing after a reload is dirty again

- **WHEN** the user reloads after a conflict and then makes an edit
- **THEN** the unsaved-changes prompt reappears on publish, so the fix does
  not turn the gate off

### Requirement: Studio's testable logic is extracted from its components

Following `packages/web/src/areas/app/screens/inboxLogic.ts`, the logic
worth testing SHALL live in pure modules with `bun:test` coverage. At
minimum, that covers two things. It covers the process-list row
derivation, which merges the process listing with the draft listing. It
covers the save/conflict state machine too. React components themselves
carry no test requirement.

Extraction into its own module earns its keep on branching or
state-machine complexity, or on guarding a documented regression class.
Caller count alone does not settle it. Neither does a component's own
resistance to `renderToStaticMarkup`. A single expression with no
independent complexity, and one caller, SHALL inline at its call site
instead. That holds even where inlining costs the expression's own narrow
test file. The expression was never the part a test could not already
read.

<!-- antislop: allow passive-voice -->
#### Scenario: Row derivation is tested without a DOM

- **WHEN** a test hands the process-list derivation a process listing and
  a draft listing
- **THEN** it returns the merged rows, and the test needs no rendering

#### Scenario: A one-caller expression with no further decision inlines instead of extracting

- **WHEN** a piece of studio logic has exactly one caller
- **AND** it carries no branch feeding further decision logic, and no state
  machine
- **AND** it guards no documented regression
- **THEN** it lives inline at its call site, not in its own pure module
  with its own test file

#### Scenario: A one-caller expression that guards a regression class stays extracted

- **WHEN** a piece of studio logic has exactly one caller
- **AND** it carries a real branch and a test suite guarding a documented
  wiring bug
- **AND** that bug is the same shape `draftToolbarState.ts` guards in its
  save/reload state machine
- **THEN** it stays in its own pure module, since caller count alone does
  not settle whether extraction earns its keep

### Requirement: The data sources panel picks a list key rather than accepting free text

For a data source of type `"db.list"`, `DataSourcesPanel` SHALL offer the
`listKey` values the server reports, rather than a free-text field. The
studio reads them through the data list read route, which its
`system:developer` role already grants.

That read SHALL carry each list's declared columns beside its key. The route
returns them today. The field catalog needs them to offer real column keys.
A second read over the same rows would let the two disagree.

A draft whose `"db.list"` data source names a `listKey` the server does not
report SHALL draw a warning, never a validation error. Publishing does not
read the tables, so a missing list cannot be an invariant here. The warning
matches the one for a step with no `assignment`.

#### Scenario: The panel offers the existing keys
- **WHEN** an author edits a `"db.list"` data source and the server reports
  two lists
- **THEN** the panel offers both keys as a choice

#### Scenario: The read carries each list's columns
- **WHEN** the server reports a list declaring two columns
- **THEN** the studio holds both column keys against that list

#### Scenario: A key the server does not report draws a warning
- **WHEN** a draft names a `listKey` the server does not report
- **THEN** the studio shows a warning for that data source

#### Scenario: The warning does not block publishing
- **WHEN** an author publishes a draft carrying that warning
- **THEN** the publish succeeds

### Requirement: A non-terminal step with no assignment draws a publish-time warning

For a non-terminal step whose `assignment` is absent, the studio SHALL draw
a warning next to the assignment editor. The warning SHALL NOT be an
`EditorIssue`, and SHALL NOT block or delay publishing. A self-service
step legitimately has no assignment, so this stays informational, matching
the rule the `"db.list"`-missing-key warning already follows.

A terminal step has no outgoing paths, so nothing is ever submitted on it.
The warning SHALL NOT draw on a terminal step, regardless of whether it
carries an `assignment`.

#### Scenario: A non-terminal step with no assignment draws a warning

- **WHEN** a draft's non-terminal step carries no `assignment`
- **THEN** the studio shows a warning next to that step's assignment editor

#### Scenario: A terminal step draws no warning

- **WHEN** a draft's step sets `terminal: true` and carries no `assignment`
- **THEN** the studio shows no warning for that step

#### Scenario: The warning does not block publishing

- **WHEN** an author publishes a draft carrying the no-assignment warning
- **THEN** the publish succeeds

### Requirement: The templates screen lists, creates and deletes a template

The studio area SHALL carry a templates screen. It SHALL list one row per
template, labelled by the `label` the stored body declares. A body may declare
no label for the active content locale. The row SHALL then fall back to the
template key, so no row renders nameless.

The screen SHALL create a template from a published version of a process, and
from no other source. That path SHALL strip the compile pass's cancel-sink
injection, because a template holds the authored shape.

A draft SHALL NOT be a source. `system:templates` cannot read one. Opening
drafts to a curator would hand them every unfinished body in the
installation.

The screen SHALL delete a template behind a confirmation. A delete SHALL
leave every process untouched.

The screen SHALL need `system:templates`. An actor holding only
`system:developer` SHALL NOT reach it. That actor still reads the templates
through the picker.

#### Scenario: A template made from a published version appears in the list

- **WHEN** a curator creates a template from a published version
- **THEN** the list carries a row for it, labelled by the body's label

#### Scenario: A template whose body declares no label still renders

- **WHEN** the list renders a template whose body carries no label for the
  active content locale
- **THEN** the row shows the template key

#### Scenario: Deleting a template asks first

- **WHEN** a curator deletes a template
- **THEN** the screen asks for a confirmation before it calls the engine

#### Scenario: An author reaches no templates screen

- **WHEN** an actor holding only `system:developer` opens the templates screen
- **THEN** the screen refuses and states which role the account lacks

### Requirement: The content-locale switcher shows a per-locale translation-gap count

For each locale `ContentLocaleSwitcher` offers, the studio SHALL count
`LocalizedText` entries with a gap. A counted entry carries the draft's
`baseLocale` value but lacks that locale's own value. The switcher SHALL
show this count next to the locale. It SHALL show nothing extra for a
locale with a count of zero. The draft's own `baseLocale` SHALL never
carry a count against itself.

An entry that lacks even the `baseLocale` value SHALL NOT count as a gap
for any other locale. The existing `EditorIssue` for a missing base-locale
value already flags that entry.

#### Scenario: A locale with translation gaps shows its count

- **WHEN** a draft's `de` locale has entries with a `baseLocale` value but
  no `de` value
- **THEN** the content-locale switcher shows `de` with that count

#### Scenario: A fully-translated locale shows no count

- **WHEN** every entry with a `baseLocale` value also carries a `de` value
- **THEN** the content-locale switcher shows `de` with no count suffix

#### Scenario: The base locale never shows a gap count

- **WHEN** the draft's `baseLocale` is `en`
- **THEN** the content-locale switcher shows `en` with no count, regardless
  of any other locale's gaps

### Requirement: A LocalizedText entry missing the current locale draws an inline warning

Take the studio's currently selected `contentLocale`. Take an entry that
carries the draft's `baseLocale` value but lacks that locale's own value.
That entry SHALL draw a warning next to its `LocalizedTextInput`. The
warning SHALL NOT be an `EditorIssue`, and SHALL NOT block or delay
publishing.

It SHALL draw at every `LocalizedTextInput` site:

- the process label
- each step's label and description
- each field's label and description
- each field option's label

An entry that lacks the `baseLocale` value SHALL NOT draw this warning.
The existing base-locale `EditorIssue` already flags it. The warning
SHALL NOT draw when `contentLocale` equals `baseLocale`.

A static rule in `packages/web/test/boundaries.test.ts` SHALL enforce that
list, scoped to `src/areas/studio/`. Every `LocalizedTextInput` rendered
there SHALL sit beside a call to `missingTranslationWarning`. An exempt site
SHALL instead carry an inline comment stating why. A hand-kept list does not
grow with the code. This rule does.

#### Scenario: A step label missing the current locale draws a warning

- **WHEN** the studio's `contentLocale` is `de`, and a draft's step has a
  `label` carrying an `en` (base locale) value but no `de` value
- **THEN** the studio shows a warning next to that step's label input

#### Scenario: An entry with the current locale filled in draws no warning

- **WHEN** a draft's field `label` carries both the base-locale value and
  the current `contentLocale`'s value
- **THEN** the studio shows no warning next to that field's label input

#### Scenario: Viewing the base locale draws no translation warning

- **WHEN** the studio's `contentLocale` equals the draft's `baseLocale`
- **THEN** the studio shows no missing-translation warning anywhere

#### Scenario: The warning does not block publishing

- **WHEN** an author publishes a draft carrying a missing-translation
  warning
- **THEN** the publish succeeds

#### Scenario: A new render site warns

- **WHEN** the studio area gains a `LocalizedTextInput` site
- **THEN** the site calls `missingTranslationWarning`
- **AND** an untranslated entry draws the warning there

#### Scenario: An unguarded site fails the suite

- **WHEN** a source file under `src/areas/studio/` renders a
  `LocalizedTextInput` with no adjacent `missingTranslationWarning` call and
  no exempting comment
- **THEN** the boundary test names the file and fails

#### Scenario: An exempt site says why

- **WHEN** a site legitimately needs no warning
- **THEN** an inline comment states the reason, and the rule skips it
